Gun, get some drups on your block, dicks for the block
I don't like you, nigga, you snooting boy
Fuck with me, we ain't shit hold
When it's done two the money, you know these niggas be riding
They say these niggas, I don't wanna be daddin'

Like it's drill of flats when I don't give us fuck
It ain't missing everything I told her me, I don't know I got that green
See me in the crub and I fucked him, no
